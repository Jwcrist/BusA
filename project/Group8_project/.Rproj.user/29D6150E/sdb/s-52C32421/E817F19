However, according to the hypothesis we would suggest that there might be a transformation that would allow us to create a better prediction. This can be seen from plotting that the Beta values may not be under the assumption of linearity.\n\n<<>>=\nggplot(Auto, aes(horsepower, mpg))+geom_point()\n@\n\n\\item\n<<>>=\nfvalue<-qf(.95,390,1)\nfvalue\n@\nThe Adjusted R-Squared value would suggest that a linear line would fit the data fairly well, but as the F-statistic shows and p-value supports that the fit is significant. However, as can be shown by graph or residuals this is a curvi-linear plot. We would need either a transformation or an adjusted curvi-linear independent value.\n\n\\item\n\n<<>>=\ncor(Auto[1:8])\n@\nThere is a negative relationship\n\n\\item\n<<>>=\n\nNewDat<-data.frame(horsepower=98)\npredict(predict1, NewDat,interval = \"confidence\", level=0.95, se.fit=FALSE)\npredict(predict1, NewDat,interval = \"prediction\", level=0.95, se.fit=FALSE)\n@\n\\end{enumerate}\n\\item\n<<>>=\nggplot(Auto, aes(horsepower,mpg))+\n  geom_point()+\n  geom_abline(intercept=39.93, slope=-0.157845)\n@\n\n\\item\nExtra Credit:\n<<>>=\nggplot(Auto, aes(horsepower,mpg))+geom_point()+\n  geom_abline(intercept=39.93, slope=-0.157845)+\n  geom_smooth(method=\"lm\", se=T)\n@\nThe fitted line goes through the mean. It is evident that the residuals of the points (from left to right) would start off positive, would then become negative, and will finish positive. By looking at this trend we would suggest that the data is either logistic or $\\frac{1}{x}$ and there might be a better fit model to the data.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n\\textbf{ANSWER FOR 9:} \\\\\n\\begin{enumerate}[(a)]\n\n\\item\n<<>>=\npairs(Auto)\n@\n\n\\item\n<<>>=\nstr(Auto)\ncor(Auto[1:8])\n@\n\n\\item\n\\begin{enumerate}[(i)]\n\\item\n<<>>=\nlm.fit<-lm(mpg~.,data=Auto[1:8])\nsummary(lm.fit)\nlm.fit<-lm(mpg~.-acceleration-cylinders-horsepower-displacement,data=Auto[1:8])\nsummary(lm.fit)\n@\nThere is some relationship between predictors and the response variable.\n\\item\n The variables which have the highest correlation would be weight, year, and origin. They are all significant to within $99.9\\%$. There were two other variables (horsepower and displacement) that would have been significant together to a $90\\%$, however; we are looking for correlations above $95\\%$ and preventing over-fitting the model they were eliminated.\n\\item\nThe $\\beta_{year}$ is equal to $.7571$. This is a positive correlation between year and mpg.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\\item\nExtra Credit\n\\item\nExtra Credit\n\\item\nExtra Credit\n\n\n\\end{enumerate}\n\\end{document}",
